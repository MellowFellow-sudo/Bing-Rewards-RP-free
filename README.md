# Bing-Rewards-RP-free
Program that makes the daily searches for PC and Mobile for now.
*The points you can win depends on the level of the account.*

# How to use üìù
First of all, you need to login to your account on Edge. The program uses the browser data to prevent the saving of credentials and avoid logging every time the program executes.

Second, install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

And, finally, change the Windows User on:
```py
WINDOWS_USER = "Neko" # Change this to your username
```
Run the program and it automatically starts Edge and makes the searches on PC mode and Mobile mode.

# Important! ‚ö†Ô∏è
You can't use Edge when te program is running, so you need to close Edge before running the program.
That's why it takes the Edge data.
