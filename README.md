# Bing-Rewards-RP-free
Program that makes the daily searches for PC and Mobile for now. (150 points each day)

# How to use üìù
First of all, you need to login to your account on Chrome. The program uses Chrome data to make the searches for avoid save credentials and make the login every time the program executes.

Second, install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

And, finally, change the Windows User on:
```py
WINDOWS_USER = "Neko" # Change this to your username
```

Run the program and it automatically starts Chrome and makes the searches on PC mode and Mobile mode.

# Important! ‚ö†Ô∏è
You can't use Chrome when te program is running, so you need to close Chrome before running the program.
That's why it takes the Chrome data.
I don't know if it can be fixed :c
